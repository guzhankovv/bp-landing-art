Then I started learning the functions of Photoshop. In the process of understanding the basics of Photoshop, I tried many styles: I tried to draw with a lasso, for example. It looks like a vector picture in a raster though. Later I found out about the so-called photo manipulations. I got interested. It is closer to what I\'m doing now. Then I was in my first year of college and tried to study extra after classes, and my pc was really poor. I was inspired by other artists I was looking for on Instagram. Then I realized that I needed a new computer and got a job at a car wash. For 3 months + scholarship, I have saved up for an average pc, which I work now on.  After that, I found out about the environment concept art, and then it all started! Now I continue to develop in this direction.'

            'Yes, of course, there are. Still, it\'s hard to say what the differences are. If you look closely, everything consists of molecules. If you look at an offline picture, it\'s a physical object and it has molecules, at the quantum level there is gravity and waves, but when you look at the screen, it\'s just a screen. This effect, which we feel instinctively, is not felt in digital art. NFT has value, and offline is something that can be touched. Art has always had to be explained to people. In addition, people needed time to understand its value. It is the same with digital art. I know a lot of people who state that digital art is not art, but I think it\'s not smart to draw such conclusions, because even if you take NFT, it brings real benefits, for example, fundraising. Touch is an ancient instinctive idea, the era where everything needs to be touched is ending. Now people live in a different reality, for them, there is a completely different reality. Behind the digital and VR, the penetration of art will be deeper.'

I used to work as a manager, but every time I would find myself opening Photoshop and tinkering with some design stuff at every opportunity possible. As time passed I was drawn more and more to design and other creative fields. In the end, I realized that I had chosen the wrong work field, the wrong job, and it was time to change it. I quit my job and decided to pursue what really interested me. At the next place of work at the event agency, despite the fact that there were no vacancies, I negotiated to brazenly come with my own equipment and work for free to prove myself. I managed to prove that design is my cup of tea, and I\'m good at it. Now I work for an IT company (Acronis) as a senior designer.'

There were many different teachers and approaches, points of view, and manners of the image. Drawing and painting literally absorbed and fascinated me. Drawing became not an occupation, but a meaning, a goal, an unattainable task, from which the eyes burned. However, it didn\'t always work out. Somewhere in the second year, I was overtaken by a digital, an outlandish thing with a button "make it beautiful", which I have not yet found. I studied CG through YouTube channels, books,speed pointss, and a bunch of other materials.'

Therefore, upon arrival, I brushed up on my studies at the British Higher School of Design and so it started. I began to paint on fairly large format canvases. I got fans and my works sold well. I took up digital art relatively recently. On one of the projects, there were a lot of creative tasks, the solution of which involved really skilled people. After watching their works, I literally fell in love with 3D. The inspiration was so great that I mastered most of the 3D modeling skills in a few months.'
